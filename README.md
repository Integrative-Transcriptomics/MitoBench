# MitoBench

[![Build Status](https://lambda.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/jenkins/job/MitoBench/badge/icon)](https://lambda.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/jenkins/job/MitoBench)

This is the main git repository for the upcoming mitoBench tool. We will have several resources here including our code, documentations (subfolder docs, to be done) and issue tracking here. 
Collaborators currently include Judith Neukamm, Alexander Peltzer and Kay Nieselt. 

The newest JAR file can be downloaded from our local Jenkins (non public until now).
