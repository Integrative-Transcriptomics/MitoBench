This is the main repository for MitoBench. MitoBench is a tool aimed at helping researchers to organize, visualize and maintain their mitochondrial datasets. Some functionality is aimed towards generating population genetics statistics with additional visualization e.g. used for the [Ancient Egyptian Mummy project](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694) which served as the motivation to build this tool. 

[Documentation can be found here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mitobench) and will be updated soon.

Development team currently includes Judith Neukamm and Alexander Peltzer.
