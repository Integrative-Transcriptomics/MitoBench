File conversion
===============

Files can be converted from one file format to another. The easiest way is importing all necessary files and export to the
required file format with the *Export data* functionality of mitoBench. Another way is using PGDSpider (citation!).
This tool is not directly embedded, but can be executed via miroBench and used as usual.
