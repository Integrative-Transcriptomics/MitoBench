Filtering
=========


Haplogroup based filtering
--------------------------

  > Edit -> Filter data ... -> ... based on PhyloTree

To filter out haplogroups that you don't want to include into your analysis, the
haplogroup based filtering provides two different ways:

1. The tree-based filtering offers the possibility to select one or multiple Haplogroups
via a tree representation of the current version of PhyloTree.

2. Instead of selecting Haplogroups in the tree, you can also enter a comma-separated
list of Haplogroups in the text field below the tree representation.

.. note::
The last filtering step can be redone via *Table -> Reset table*.




Haplotype-based filtering
--------------------------

  > Edit -> Filter data ... -> ... haplotype filtering

Another way to filter data is the haplotype-based filtering. You can enter one or
multiple Haplotypes (as a comma-separated list). This filters out all samples that
do not have this haplotype.

You can also specify a distance value d. This will include all Haplotypes
with the distance d to the specified ones.
