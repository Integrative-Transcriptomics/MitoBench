Filtering
=========


Haplogroup based filtering
--------------------------

> Edit -> Filter data ... -> ... based on PhyloTree

To filter out haplogroups that you don't ant to include into your analysis, the
haplogroup based filtering provides different ways to do this.

The tree based filtering offers the possibility to select one or multile Haplogroups
via a tree representation of the current version of PhyloTree.

Instead of selecting Haplogroups in the tree, you also can enter a comma-separated
list of Haplogroups in the text filed below the tree representation.

.. note::
    The last filtering step can be redone via *Table -> Reset table*.




Haplotype based filtering
--------------------------

> Edit -> Filter data ... -> ... haplotype filtering

Another way to filter data is the haplotype based filtering. You can enter one or
multiple haplotypes (as comma-separated list). This filters out all samples that
do not have this haplotype.

You also can specify a distance value d (integer). This will include all haplotypes
with the distance d to the specified ones.
