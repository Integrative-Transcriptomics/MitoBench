Prerequisites for the installation of mitoBench
-----------------------------------------------

Operating System Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mitoBench has been implemented as a platform independent tool and can thus be installed on Linux, Windows and MacOS. A Java 8+ platform has to be installed on the workstation used for running the tool. 

Linux
^^^^^

It has been successfully tested on different flavours of Linux based operating systems, including ArchLinux and Ubuntu 17.04.


Mac OSX
^^^^^^^

The application works out of the box on macOS X 10.12 Sierra. An up to date Java Runtime Environment (>8) is required to run the application. 

Windows
^^^^^^^

The application can be run on Windows 10. Solely the log file cannot be saved in the end for now.

Software Requirements for mitoBench
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install a suitable Java 8 runtime environment. We tested both Oracle Java 8 SE and OpenJRE 8 on Linux. The latter requires to install JavaFX in addition, whether the Oracle JRE already ships with the required JavaFX libraries.
