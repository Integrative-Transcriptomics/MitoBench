File conversion
===============

mitoBech provides different file conversions via the data :ref:`export function <export-label>`.

For file formats not supported by mitoBench, PDGSpider (for more information see `here <https://heidi.chnebu.ch/doku.php?id=pgdspider>`_)
is accessible to converted from one file format to another. This tools is only called via mitobench but works completely independent.
