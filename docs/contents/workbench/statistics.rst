Haplogroup counts
----------------

> Statistics -> Count Haplogroups

This counts the Haplogroups per group - or of the entire data set - if no grouping is defined.
The result is represented in a table format and can be exported via *File -> Export statistics*.



Haplotype frequency
-------------------

> Statistics -> Calculate Haplotype frequency

This calculates the occurrence and frequency of each haplotype based on the current version
of PhyloTree. The result also contains the Haplogroups assigned to the Haplotype.
