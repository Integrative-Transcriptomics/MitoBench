Grouping
========

Many analysis tools require grouping of the data. Moreover, grouping allows comparing e.g. different time periods or different locations. mitoBench is flexible in terms of grouping - you can basically define any criterion in the table for grouping.


- Grouping by column
    Select *Grouping -> Group by column* and choose the column that defines the grouping.

.. note::
   After grouping the data, the column name of the column that defines the grouping
   is extended by the word *(Grouping)*.
