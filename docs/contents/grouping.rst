Grouping
========

Many analysis tools requires a grouping of the data. Moreover, grouping allows to
compare e.g. different time periods or different locations.


- Grouping by column
    Select *Grouping -> Group by column* and choose the column that defines the grouping.

.. note::
   After grouping the data, the column name of the column that defines the grouping
   is extended by the word *(Grouping)*.
