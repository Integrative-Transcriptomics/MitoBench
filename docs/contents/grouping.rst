Grouping
========

Many analysis tools requires a grouping of the data. Moreover, grouping allows to
compare e.g. different time periods or different locations.

The grouping via mitoBench can be done in two different ways:

1. User-defined grouping

   1.1 Create new group

      Select the data you want to group, right-click the selection and choose
      *Create new group*. The name of the group can be set in the dialogue that pops up.

   1.2 Add data to existing group

      Select the data you want to add to an already existing group, right-click and choose
      *Add to group*. You can now specify the group to which the data has to be added.


2. Grouping by column
    Select *Grouping -> Group by column* and choose the column that defines the grouping.

.. note::
   After grouping the data, the column name of the column that defines the grouping
   is extended by the word *(Grouping)*.
