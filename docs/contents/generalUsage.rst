General Usage
=============


The mitoBench can be used to upload and convert files and to manipulate, analyze and
visualize mitochondrial data.

The main window is split into three parts. The upper part contains a visualization
panel on the left and a statistics/analysis pane on the right side. The part below
represents the samples in a table format. After logging in to the database, this
part will include the database view as well.

mitoBench can be used in offline mode. However, some features (such
as the map view and the DB import) require a working internet connection. The faster - the better.



Table
------

It is possible to add and delete columns to the table as well as adding and replacing data by right-clicking on the table. Adding a new column requires a default value. This value can be replaced easily later.

Log file
--------

By closing mitoBench, you will be asked if you want to save a log file.
This file contains all steps that were done during your analysis with mitoBench,
which helps you to reconstruct your analysis at a later date.
